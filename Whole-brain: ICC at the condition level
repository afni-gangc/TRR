# Bleow is a shell script using 3dICC in AFNI that performs intraclass correleation (ICC) 
# analysis through condition-level modeling at the whole-brain voxel-wise level with data 
# for the conflict contrast in a Flanker task between two conditions: 42 subjects, two 
# sessions, two conditions (congruent and incongrugent).

3dICC -prefix conflict-ICC \

      -model '1+Session+(1|Subj)' \
      -dataTable @conflict.txt
      
# The file "conflict.txt" contains the input data information in a long format with a header
# that indicates the columns. Specificially, the first column lists the subject labels (20608,
# ...), the second column identifies the two sessions (Time1 and Time2), the third column 
# provides the 3D data (contrast between congruent and incongruent from individual subject 
# level).
